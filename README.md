# Count Training Data
This Python script counts the total number of images in a directory that can be used as training data for machine learning models. It supports three image file extensions: .jpg, .jpeg, and .png.

The script uses the os and glob modules in Python to find all image files in the specified directory, and then prints the total number of images found. The output can be easily copied to a spreadsheet or document for record-keeping.

This script can be useful for data scientists and machine learning engineers who need to keep track of the size and composition of their training data sets. It is compatible with both Python 2 and 3, and can be run on any operating system that supports Python.

# Installation

To use this script, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jawabreh0/count-training-data
```

Then, navigate to the repository directory and run the Python script:
```bash
cd count-training-data
python get-total.py /path/to/your/image/directory
```

Replace /path/to/your/image/directory with the actual directory path where your image files are stored.
